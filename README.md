The purpose of this scraper is to track basic data on
how MP positions for each policy in [They Vote For You](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au)
change over time.

The [They Vote For You API](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/help/data#policy)
provides more detailed data on MP positions for the current time,
but this scraper allows you to see how many MPs were in each category on a specific date.

This information is useful for me for an experiment I want to hack on,
and I thought it might be an interesting thing to look back on one day.
